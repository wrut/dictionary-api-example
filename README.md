<h1>Readme for Word Definitions and Examples</h1>
<p>This code uses the <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/">OpenPyXL</a> library to create an Excel spreadsheet containing definitions and example sentences for a list of words. It also uses the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html">concurrent.futures</a> module to make requests to the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/">dictionaryapi.dev</a> API in parallel, which speeds up the process of retrieving definitions and examples for the words.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>OpenPyXL</li>
  <li>Requests</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install the required libraries by running the following command:
<pre><code>pip install openpyxl requests</code></pre></li>
  <li>Create a text file named <code>words.txt</code> containing the words for which you want to get definitions and examples. Place the file in the same directory as the script.</li>
  <li>Run the script using the following command:
<pre><code>python script.py</code></pre></li>
  <li>The script will create an Excel file named <code>words.xlsx</code> containing the definitions and examples for the words in the <code>words.txt</code> file. Each row in the spreadsheet will contain the following columns:
    <ul>
      <li>Word</li>
      <li>Definition</li>
      <li>Example sentence</li>
      <li>Blank sentence (with the word replaced by a blank space)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose the <code>words.txt</code> file contains the following words:</p>
<pre><code>dog
cat
fish
bird</code></pre>
<p>After running the script, the <code>words.xlsx</code> file will contain the following rows:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Word</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
      <th>Example sentence</th>
      <th>Blank sentence</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>dog</td>
      <td>a domesticated carnivorous mammal that typically has a long snout, an acute sense of smell, and a barking, howling, or whining voice.</td>
      <td>The dog chased after the ball.</td>
      <td>The ___ chased after the ball.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>cat</td>
      <td>a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractile claws.</td>
      <td>The cat sat on the windowsill.</td>
      <td>The ___ sat on the windowsill.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
  <td>fish</td>
  <td>a limbless cold-blooded vertebrate animal with gills and fins and living wholly in water.</td>
  <td>The fish swam in the pond.</td>
  <td>The ___ swam in the pond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>bird</td>
  <td>a warm-blooded egg-laying vertebrate distinguished by the possession of feathers, wings, and a beak and (typically) by being able to fly.</td>
  <td>The bird sang in the tree.</td>
  <td>The ___ sang in the tree.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a word is not found in the dictionary, a message will be printed to the console indicating that the word was not found.</li>
  <li>If there is a problem parsing the JSON data for a word, an error message will be printed to the console.</li>
</ul>
